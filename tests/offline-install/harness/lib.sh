# push it takes SIGPIPE (141).  pipefail then makes the PIPELINE non-zero, so the `if`
# reads a HIT as "not found" — a silent false-negative.  Measured on this suite's own
# ~10 KiB driver output: 16 false-FAILs in 400 runs (~4%) of exactly this shape, which is
# how T17/T23/Baseline-T20 reported "output does not contain X" while the dumped output
