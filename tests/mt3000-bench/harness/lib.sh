# Shared helpers for the offline bench-harness tests (tests/mt3000-bench/run-tests.sh).

# Nothing here touches a router: the harness is a throw-away directory that stands in for
# the router's filesystem, plus PATH doubles for ssh/scp/apk (harness/bin/).
#
# HERMETICITY OF THE BENCH LOCK (why this file owns a "production lock" concept at all)
#   The suite takes and releases bench locks to assert ownership semantics, so it must NEVER do
#   that on the production lock file (~/.hermes/state/bench-mt3000.lock). A live bench run holds
#   exactly that file, and rewriting or clearing its holder line invalidates the run under it.
#   Two consequences:
#     * 2026-09-26 the suite was SIGTERMed with no verdict while the bench was busy — a suite that
#       cannot run whenever the bench is in use is a trap for every worker and for CI;
#     * 2026-09-27, reproduced in a sandbox: pointed at the production lock shape with a live flock
#       held, the pre-fix suite DELETED the lock file from its first case — the holder line was
#       GONE and the path was takeable again (flock FREE) while the live run's flock sat on an
#       unlinked inode, i.e. a second window could take the bench under a run that believed it
#       owned it. The pre-fix suite did not BLOCK in that experiment (it re-creates the file after
#       unlinking, so it never contends): the reachable harm is the destroyed holder metadata and
#       the defeated flock.
#   So: the suite owns a private lock INSIDE its workdir, `bench_assert_private_lock` refuses to
#   start against the production path (exit 90, loud), every command it runs is BOUNDED
#   (`run_cmd`), and `prod_lock_fingerprint` lets the end of the run PROVE the production file —
#   holder line included — is exactly what it was at the start.

# 10 — a MAC in the first line of a window), 166 of 300 calls false-FAILed (55%), which is how this
