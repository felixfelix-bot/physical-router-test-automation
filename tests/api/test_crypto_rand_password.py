"""Tests for PR #111: Crypto-secure random password generation.

PR #111 (fix/security-crypto-rand) changes generateRandomPassword() to use
crypto/rand instead of math/rand for WPA2 password generation.

Key behaviors under test:
- Password follows the Word-Word-Word-NN pattern (e.g. "Maple-Tiger-Brave-42")
- Each word segment starts with uppercase followed by lowercase
- Ends with 2+ digits
- The `network set-private-network` command is available via Unix socket

These tests establish the BASELINE behavior on whatever firmware is currently
deployed. If the commands don't exist yet (PR not deployed), tests skip with
informative messages documenting what PR #111 would add.
