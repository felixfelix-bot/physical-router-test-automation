"""Invoice-layer double-spend prevention tests (regression for #257).

These tests verify that the tollgate backend's Lightning invoice layer handles
concurrent and repeated requests safely -- the closest local approximation of
Cashu double-spend rejection without a full NDS/DHCP MAC-resolution stack.

Background: #257 is a swap-counter race where the same blinded message can be
reused across swap operations. We cannot exercise the Cashu ``POST /`` path
locally because it requires MAC resolution via NDS/DHCP, which is only
available on a real router with an authenticated client. The invoice layer
(``POST /ln-invoice`` / ``GET /ln-invoice?quote=...``) is MAC-independent and
shares the same quote/swap state machine, making it the best available proxy.

Token creation reference (for tests that need a real Cashu token)::

    from lib.cashu_fixture import create_minter
    minter = create_minter('http://10.99.99.2:8383')
    token = minter.mint(4)

Environment: OpenWrt VM at 10.99.99.1:2121, CDK mint at
http://10.99.99.2:8383. Run with ``--backend go``.
