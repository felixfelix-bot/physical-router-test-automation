"""Verify SSRF callback URL validation (PR #198, issue #205).

PR #198 (``fix/ssrf-lnurl-validation-12``) adds IP validation to
``GetInvoiceFromLightningAddress`` so a malicious Lightning Address provider
cannot make the router GET internal endpoints (loopback, RFC 1918, link-local
such as the cloud metadata ``169.254.169.254``, unspecified).

The guarded function is reached only from ``tollwallet.MeltToLightning`` — the
profit-share payout path — so a full black-box router test needs ecash funds, a
mock LNURL-pay server, and a ``/etc/hosts`` entry. That integration is provided
below as an opt-in test; the default, always-runnable coverage is:

1. **Deployed-binary check**: the SSRF block string ("callback URL points to
   blocked address") is compiled into the on-router ``tollgate-wrt`` binary.
   This proves the fix shipped in the artifact, not just in the source branch.
2. **Unit-level correctness** is established out-of-band by the 9 tests in
   ``src/lightning/ssrf_validation_test.go`` (``TestValidateCallbackURL_*``),
   which block loopback, IPv6 ::1, RFC 1918, link-local 169.254.169.254, and
   unspecified 0.0.0.0 while passing public domains/IPs and CGNAT. Run locally::

       cd src/lightning && go test -run ValidateCallbackURL -v

Known gap (documented, not blocked by this PR): the inline check calls
``net.ParseIP(host)`` and only fires when the callback host is a *literal* IP.
A *domain* that resolves to an internal address (DNS rebinding) is NOT blocked.
The Go unit tests explicitly do not cover this; tracked separately.
