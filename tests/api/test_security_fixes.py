"""Tests for security fixes in PR #104.

PR #104 (merged as 8ec5342) fixed three security issues:
1. Mint URL case-insensitive matching
2. Double-spent token detection (not crashing)
3. X-Forwarded-For header trust from localhost only

See: https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-knowledgebase/tree/main/incidents/2026-01-XX_security-fixes-pr104
