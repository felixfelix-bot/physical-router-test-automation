"""WGM (Wireless Gateway Manager) startup check tests.

Verifies that the WGM startup connectivity check (introduced in PR #122)
executes cleanly with and without WiFi radios present.

Feature-detected: all tests skip when WGM startup check log patterns
are absent, so they run against any firmware version that includes
the feature — no ``--expected-pr`` needed.
