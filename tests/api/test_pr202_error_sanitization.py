"""Verify error-response sanitization (PR #202, closes audit finding S3 from #177).

PR #202 (``fix/sanitize-error-responses``) replaces ``err.Error()`` with generic
messages in 4 JSON response paths in ``src/main.go`` so internal Go error details
(file paths, library names, connection strings, dial errors) never leak to API
clients. The server-side logger still records the full error for debugging.

This test exercises the deployable paths at router level:

1. ``POST /ln-invoice`` with an **unreachable mint URL** -> the invoice-creation
   error path fires. Response ``error`` must be the generic
   ``"failed to create lightning invoice"`` and must NOT contain internal markers
   (``dial tcp``, ``connection refused``, library names, ``.go`` file paths).
2. ``logread`` must still contain the FULL error detail (proving the server kept
   diagnostics while only sanitizing the wire response).
3. ``/balance`` error path is harder to trigger deterministically (an unknown MAC
   returns a no-session 200, not an error), so we assert on the deployed binary
   containing the sanitized literal strings rather than a leak-prone ``err.Error()``.

Gating: ``gate_bug_fix`` flips the test to xfail ("known issue") when the deployed
firmware predates PR #202 — i.e. the live response still leaks an internal error
string. When PR #202 is present the test runs normally; a failure means the fix
regressed.
