"""Tests for advanced recovery lifecycle scenarios.

Verifies edge cases in the mint resilience lifecycle:
- Multiple degrade/recover cycles (provider handles repeated swaps)
- Health tracker stays alive after first recovery
- Flapping mint (intermittent block/unblock) — hysteresis prevents flip-flop

These tests are marked 'extended' (not 'destructive') because teardown
restores the router to its original working state.
