"""
Test NDS firewall integration with fw4/nftables on OpenWrt 24.10+.

BUG: Client shows "Authenticated" in ndsctl but cannot access internet.

ROOT CAUSE: NDS 5.0.2 inserts filter rules into iptables-nft tables
(ip filter FORWARD → ndsNET chain). OpenWrt 24.10 uses fw4/nftables
(inet fw4 forward chain with policy drop). When fw4's forward chain
accepts LAN→WAN traffic, the packet never reaches the ip filter FORWARD
chain where NDS's accept/reject rules live. NDS's ndsNET chain shows
0 packets — its verdict is never applied.

This means:
- NDS authentication marks (0x30000) are applied in mangle/nat tables
- But the actual accept/drop decision for forwarded traffic is made by
  fw4, not by NDS
- NDS cannot actually enforce its authentication gate on forwarded traffic
