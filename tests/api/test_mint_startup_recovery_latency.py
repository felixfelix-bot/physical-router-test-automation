"""Diagnostic: measure startup mint-recovery latency (A/B instrument).

This is the diagnostic instrument for evaluating the "aggressive mint health
check retry on startup" change (upstream commit 32f43d8). It measures how long
the backend takes to recover when mints are unreachable AT STARTUP and then
become reachable again.

Unlike the correctness tests in test_degraded_mode.py (which only assert that
recovery eventually happens), this test MEASURES AND REPORTS the latency. It
deliberately does NOT hard-fail on a tight threshold, so it can be run
diagnostically against both:

  - upstream ``main``   -> expected slow recovery (minutes): the normal 5-minute
                           proactive ticker drives recovery, with the 3-success
                           recovery threshold.
  - patched branch      -> expected fast recovery (~15-30s): the aggressive
                           15s retry with threshold=1 fires at startup because
                           ``reachableCount == 0``.

The measured latency is emitted on a dedicated marker line so it can be
harvested straight out of the cloud run's ``output.log``:

    >>> STARTUP_RECOVERY_LATENCY: 287s <<<

The A/B delta (main vs patched) is the evidence that the startup-retry issue
is real and quantifies its severity:
  - main recovers in minutes, patched in seconds  -> reliability/speed fix
  - main never recovers within the window         -> correctness fix (higher
                                                     severity than assumed)

Scenario:
  1. Resolve mint IPs and block all of them via iptables (mints unreachable).
  2. Restart the backend so it boots with ``reachableCount == 0`` (startup path
     that the aggressive-retry change keys on).
  3. Confirm the backend actually entered a no-reachable-mint state at boot
     (otherwise the test is invalid — the block did not take effect).
  4. ``t0`` = the moment the mints are unblocked.
  5. Poll the router logs for the first recovery signal; record ``t_recover``.
  6. Report the latency. This is a pure measurement instrument: it does NOT
     assert on the latency, so the same green test runs on both main (slow)
     and the patched branch (fast) and the A/B delta is read from the reported
     ``STARTUP_RECOVERY_LATENCY`` numbers.
