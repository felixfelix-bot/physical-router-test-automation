# First phone-payment E2E through the rig — beta DUT (OpenWrt 24.10.8,
# tollgate-wrt v0.6.0-alpha4), moto g(7) power (LineageOS, Android 15) over
# WiFi, driven via uiautomator2 per ~/android-tooling-brief.md.
#
# Flow: phone joins beta's open TollGate SSID (TollGate-E782) via
# `cmd wifi connect-network` (non-privileged on Android 15), opens the
# captive portal with a TIP-03 prehydrated Cashu token
# (splash.html?token=... -> window.__INITIAL_TOKEN__, consumed by the SPA on
# first render — the browser equivalent of pay_direct()), the backend
# consumes the token and authenticates the phone's MAC with NDS, and the
# phone's network flips to VALIDATED with working internet.
#
# Payment path: one-intent TIP-03 prehydration. Fallbacks, in order:
#   1. tap the portal's purchase/submit button (SPA prehydrated the field
#      but waits for confirmation);
#   2. u2 set_text the token into the field (u2 round-trips 400+ chars
#      exactly; adb `input text` silently truncates near 200 and is never
#      used here).
#
# Auth assertions deliberately avoid router.wait_for_auth(): its >10s
# fallback runs `ndsctl auth <mac>` manually, which would grant internet
# even if the payment never went through. This test must only pass on a
# REAL payment, so NDS state is polled directly. After authentication is
# observed, the NDS 5.0.2 auth-mark repair (fix_nodogsplash_auth_marks —
# a packet-mark fix for already-authenticated clients, not an auth grant)
# is applied so new connections from the phone are accepted.
