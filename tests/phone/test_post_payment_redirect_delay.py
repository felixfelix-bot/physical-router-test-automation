"""Tests for post-payment redirect auth delay behavior.

Verifies the auth delay mechanism introduced in feat/post-payment-redirect
(commit b0d1320). When redirect_url is configured, the Go binary delays
ndsctl auth by 8 seconds to give the captive portal WebView time to load
the welcome page before Android detects connectivity and kills the WebView.

These tests surface two known bugs:
- Bug #3 (Amperstrand/tollgate-module-basic-go#3): delayedAuth() gives
  users ~8s bonus session time because the deauth timer is calculated from
  the original durationSeconds, not adjusted for the delay.
- Bug #4 (Amperstrand/tollgate-module-basic-go#4): concurrent payments
  during the delay window cause double ndsctl auth goroutines, and session
  extensions during delay are silently lost.

Tests are marked xfail until the corresponding fixes land.
Feature-detected: skip if welcome.html is absent (no redirect feature).

Flow:
  payment → valve.OpenGateUntil() → delayedAuth goroutine (8s sleep)
  → ndsctl auth → deauth timer fires at untilTimestamp + ~8s (bug #3)
