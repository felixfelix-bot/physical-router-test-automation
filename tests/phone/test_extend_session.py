# Session Extension (Top-Up)
#
# Verifies that paying a second time extends the existing session's allotment.
# Known issue: as of current main, the backend returns the same allotment on
# repeated payments — it replaces the session instead of adding to it. The test
# uses pytest.xfail to record this as an expected failure without blocking the
# suite. This is a pre-existing behavior, not a regression from PR #120.
