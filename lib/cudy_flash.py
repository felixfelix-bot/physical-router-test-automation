"""Cudy WR3000 **v1** two-stage OpenWrt flash lane — pure, offline-testable logic.

The operator's requirement: *"the physical router testing kit should have the
ability to flash OpenWrt and TollGate on these Cudy routers."*  This module is
the decision half of that lane; :mod:`scripts.cudy_flash` wires it to HTTP/SSH
and does the destructive parts.

Why two stages (OpenWrt TOH, "OEM easy installation", for Cudy WR3000 v1):

* the **stock** CudyOS web UI refuses a mainline OpenWrt image — Cudy signs its
  own images and ships no signature-disable build, so an unsigned sysupgrade is
  rejected;
* it *does* accept **Cudy's own signed OpenWrt** transitional image, and once
  that is running a real OpenWrt, the ordinary mainline ``sysupgrade`` path is
  available.  No case opening, no UART.

    stage 1  vendor UI upload of the vendored Cudy-signed transitional image
             (``openwrt-mediatek-filogic-cudy_wr3000-v1-sysupgrade.bin``) —
             192.168.10.1 -> reboot -> 192.168.1.1, Wi-Fi interfaces DISABLED
    stage 2  mainline ``sysupgrade -n`` of OpenWrt 25.12.x for the same
             target/board (staged over ssh stdin — these builds have no
             sftp-server, so ``scp``/``sftp`` are not a transport here)
    stage 3  TollGate install — NOT reimplemented here: the kit already owns it
             (see :func:`tollgate_install_handoff`)

Hard guards kept from the rest of the kit (import, never re-invent):

* :mod:`lib.fresh_flash` owns the destructive-switch gate
  (``TOLLGATE_ENABLE_SYSUPGRADE_FLASHING``), ``FlashRefused``/``ImageInvalid``,
  the wallet gate (a probe that did not answer is *unknown*, never "empty"), and
  the sysupgrade/board-identity command builders;
* :mod:`lib.install_paths` owns the TollGate artifact + install-path machinery.

HONESTY / EVIDENCE-FIRST

Stage 1's upload endpoint and form shape are **pinned from a real hardware run on
2026-09-27** (Cudy WR3000 v1, this bench): the Firmware *modal* on
``/cgi-bin/luci/admin/panel`` loads the JS; attaching the image to the file input
``cbid.upgrade.1.firmware`` (``accept=.bin``) makes the page's own onchange POST it to
``/cgi-bin/luci/admin/system/upgrade`` (HTTP 200), a ``Proceed`` button then appears and
clicking it POSTs again (HTTP 302, redirect to ``…/reboot?upgrade=`` →
``/reboot/apply?upgrade=true``).  A bare GET of ``…/system/upgrade`` returns a ~2.6 KB
fragment in which ``window.upload_file`` is undefined — the modal is what loads it.

Stage 2 (mainline ``sysupgrade`` over an ssh stdin redirect) was also exercised end to end
on that run.  ``docs/cudy-wr3000-flashing.md`` records exactly which parts of this lane are
hardware-verified, which are unit-tested only, and which remain unverified (notably the
*volatile / RAM* install, which is implemented but has NOT been run on hardware).

The flash-capacity wall found on that run (a 16 MB device cannot hold the 21 MB
uncompressed *default* TollGate payload in its 4.6 MB free overlay) is modelled here as a
hard preflight (``check_install_capacity``).  A later hardware measurement (2026-09-27,
same WR3000 v1) proved the project's existing ``upx-ultra-brute`` payload — 5,601,262 B
(5.34 MiB) uncompressed — **does** fit the free overlay and **survives a reboot**, so the
preflight now points FIRST at that compressed variant, then at dropping the ``tollgate``
CLI to make room for the dependency closure, and only then at the volatile (tmpfs)
install (``volatile_install_plan``) as a bench fallback — rather than letting the default
payload die mid-extract with ENOSPC.

#
# A Cudy WR3000 v1 has 16 MB SPI-NOR.  Measured on the bench box:
#   mtd5  firmware   15.1 MB (0xf10000) = kernel (mtd6, 4.2 MB) + rootfs (mtd7, 10.8 MB)
#   mtd8  rootfs_data    5.9 MB, of which only ~4.6 MB was FREE (the jffs2 overlay)
#   the DEFAULT tollgate-wrt payload, UNCOMPRESSED = 21 MB:
#       usr/bin/tollgate-wrt  12,361,280 B
#       usr/bin/tollgate       7,373,632 B
#       etc/ 924 K, www/ 216 K, lib/ ~1.2 MB
#   the DEFAULT .apk/.ipk is 8.5 MB COMPRESSED — it cannot be unpacked into 4.6 MB free.
# So `apk` dies mid-extract: `failed to extract usr/bin/tollgate-wrt: No space left on
# device`.  A custom ImageBuilder image fails the same arithmetic (base squashfs ~6.5 MB +
# kernel 3.2 MB + ~8.5 MB compressed payload > 15.1 MB firmware area).
#
# THE MISSING HALF, MEASURED ON HARDWARE 2026-09-27 (same WR3000 v1, dev-channel artifact):
#   the project's CI already builds a `upx-ultra-brute` variant for aarch64_cortex-a53 /

#       ~256 KB of config/captive-portal files
#   It FITS and is PERSISTENT: `apk add --no-network --allow-untrusted --force-non-repository
#   /tmp/upx.apk` succeeded, registered `tollgate-wrt` in the apk DB, the UPX-compressed Go
#   binaries execute on the router kernel, and after a real reboot (uptime 1 min) tollgate-wrt
#   was RUNNING with /tmp/tg absent and the binaries still on flash.  Overlay after install:
#   5.8 M used / 0.16 M free (97%).
#   TWO TRAPS measured that the advisory must carry:
#     (a) `apk add --force-non-repository <file>` performs a world sync and REMOVES packages
#         previously installed from files (not in any repository): nodogsplash, jq,
#         iptables-nft and libmicrohttpd-no-ssl silently vanished after the module install.
#         Fix: install the whole dependency closure in ONE `apk add` transaction, or take
#         nodogsplash from the feed repositories / bake it into the image.
#     (b) Freeing the `tollgate` CLI (1,867,032 B / 1.78 MiB) — only needed for provisioning,
#         which runs once — makes room for the nodogsplash closure on a 16 MB device: overlay
#         went to 2.0 MB free after dropping it, and 1016 KB free after reinstalling the
#         37-package closure.
#   NOTE: the feed RELEASE does not publish the compressed variant (only default builds), so
#   today a device cannot fetch it from a release; tracked in FreedomTechFeed/packages PR #39.
#
# The volatile (tmpfs) install stays the FALLBACK for bench work that cannot free the space:
# the two big binaries live in /tmp and are symlinked from /usr/bin, the small parts (~1.2 MB)
# go on flash.  It is NOT persistent, and this module says so loudly.
