"""Fresh-flash prerequisite for the install-path scenarios.

The dual-install-path coverage needs a *clean* OpenWrt 25.12.x image: the whole
point is that a bare package install and the installer path both produce the
same policy on a freshly flashed router, with no state carried over.

Flashing is destructive, so this module is deliberately paranoid:

* the image must look like an OpenWrt **25.12.x mediatek/filogic
  glinet_gl-mt3000 sysupgrade** image, and its sha256 must match the upstream
  ``sha256sums``;
* ``sysupgrade -n`` (never keep config) is the only flash mode this harness
  issues;
* the router wallet must be **empty** — ``/etc/tollgate/ecash`` holds real
  ecash, and ``sysupgrade -n`` wipes it.  Draining is the *operator's* step
  (``tollgate wallet drain cashu --yes``); the harness refuses to flash a
  non-empty wallet unless ``--allow-nonempty-wallet`` is passed explicitly.
  The gate **fails closed**: a wallet the probe did not answer for (unreachable
  router, no ``tollgate`` CLI, service down) is *unknown*, which is not the same
  as empty, and it refuses too.

The module is pure logic + shell builders so it can be unit-tested without a
router; :mod:`scripts.fresh_flash` wires it to SSH under the bench lock.
