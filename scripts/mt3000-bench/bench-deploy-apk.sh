#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# bench-deploy-apk.sh — deploy ONE named .apk to the bench MT3000, while holding the
# single-owner bench lock, and then PROVE what actually got installed.
#
# It exists because "the install exited 0 and a smoke test passed" is not identity
# evidence, and because a leftover /tmp/*.apk on the bench is a loaded gun:
#
#   1. NO LOCK, NO INSTALL. It refuses unless it is running inside a bench lock window
#      (`bench-with-lock.sh` / `bench-lock.sh exec`). See scripts/mt3000-bench/bench-lock.sh.
#   2. IT NAMES ITS ARTIFACT. `--apk FILE --sha256 HEX` is mandatory: the helper prints the
#      path, size and sha256 it intends to install, and refuses if the file does not hash
#      to the sha256 it was told to expect. It also extracts usr/bin/tollgate-wrt from that
#      apk and records the PAYLOAD sha256 — the identity it will verify after the install.
#   3. IT ROTATES STALE STAGED APKS. Every /tmp/*.apk it did not stage for this window is
#      renamed aside (`.rotated-<ts>`) and reported — never deleted, another window may own
#      the bytes. `--refuse-foreign-staged` refuses instead of rotating.
#   4. IT REFUSES SUBSTITUTED ARTIFACTS. If an apk is already staged under the name this
#      deploy intends to use but its bytes differ from the named artifact, or if
#      /etc/tollgate/install.json `package_path` points at an apk (the revert bomb), the
#      helper stops BEFORE installing.
#   5. IT VERIFIES THE INSTALLED BINARY. After the install it reads
#      `sha256sum $TG_BIN/tollgate-wrt` + size on the router and compares them with the
#      payload bytes extracted from the named artifact. Mismatch => loud failure (exit 8),
#      with both hashes and the router's apk.log tail as forensics. Exit code is never
#      treated as identity evidence.
#
# USAGE
#   bench-with-lock.sh --purpose "deploy <build>" -- \
#       bench-deploy-apk.sh --apk /path/tollgate-wrt-....apk --sha256 <64 hex> \
#           [--name <basename to stage as>] [--router 192.168.1.1] \
#           [--task t_xxxx] [--verify-only] [--dry-run] \
#           [--refuse-foreign-staged] [--clear-package-path] [--install-timeout SECONDS]
#
#   --verify-only   read-only: verify the router's CURRENT installed identity against the
#                   named artifact (no rotation, no upload, no install). This is the honest
#                   way to check "is the bench still running the build I handed over?".
#   --dry-run       do everything up to (not including) the install.
#
# EXIT CODES
#   0 ok | 2 usage | 4 not holding the bench lock | 6 local artifact/tooling problem
#   7 substituted/stale-staged artifact or package_path refusal (nothing installed)
#   8 installed identity MISMATCH (loud) | 9 transfer failed (nothing installed)
#   10 install did not complete
#   11 the DEVICE pin refused (wrong box on this address — nothing staged, nothing installed)
#
# THE DEVICE PIN (fail closed when this bench is pinned). Two routers can answer on ONE
# address (measured 2026-09-28: the GL-MT3000 on this host's enp0s31f6 and a Cudy WR3000 on
# a USB dongle, both at 192.168.1.1) and an install then lands on the box nobody meant to
# touch. If `BENCH_BOX` names a box record (or `BENCH_DEVICE_IDENTITY` names one file) the
# pin is verified HERE, before anything is staged, and any refusal stops the deploy:
#   scripts/bench/device-identity.sh verify --name "$BENCH_BOX" || exit $?
# Unset it and this deploy says so out loud (one line) but still runs — the guard cannot
# make an unpinned caller safe. `--require-identity` makes an unset pin a refusal (exit 11).
#
# CREDENTIALS: never on argv, never in this file. The lab credential is read from
# $BENCH_ROUTER_PW_FILE (default ~/.tg-e2e/pw) or, as a warned fallback,
# $BENCH_ROUTER_PASSWORD. See the `tollgate-development` skill (physical-router-testing →
# references/lab-credentials-and-http-probe.md).
#
# TEST SEAM (offline harness only): the remote scripts read TG_TMP / TG_BIN / TG_ETC /
# TG_APKLOG (defaults /tmp, /usr/bin, /etc/tollgate, /var/log/apk.log). The no-router test
# double in tests/mt3000-bench/harness/ exports these into a throw-away root so the SAME
# script text runs against a stand-in router. Nothing else in this file is test-aware.
