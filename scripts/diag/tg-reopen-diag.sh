# Usage:
#   ssh root@<router> 'sh -s' < <(curl -fsSL <url>)
#   ssh root@<router> 'sh -s <client-mac>' < <(curl -fsSL <url>)     # pin the client

       # NOTE: run this AFTER capturing section 5 above — the stale config is the evidence.

  B) THE STUCK CLIENT (the discriminating experiment for "balance back, gate shut"):
       ndsctl deauth <client-mac>          # drop the stale nodogsplash session
       # then reload the portal on the client and/or let the OS probe re-fire.
       # OUTCOMES:
       #   - the portal appears and, after entering/continuing, the internet works
       #       => the bug is a STALE ND SESSION: the client stayed "authenticated"
       #          across the exhaustion, so nothing re-interrogated it, and the top-up
       #          never refreshed its authorisation. Report this verbatim.
       #   - still dead => the block is in nftables (see the counters in section 3):
       #          the mark was never flipped back. Report the chain with counters.
